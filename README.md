We created a better “save for later” feature on Facebook. On the newsfeed, we have the option to add individual newsfeed cards to “save for later” and it will be pushed to a list of posts we’ve saved in the past. The list can be expanded from the side of the newsfeed to show the heading of the post and a preview. If the user decides to read the post, they click it and it links to the original post. The user has the option of clicking an “I’m done” button to archive the post. Afterwards, the user can see suggested posts to read based on what they’ve saved for later.
